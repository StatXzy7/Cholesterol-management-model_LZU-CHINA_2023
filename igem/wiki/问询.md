去slack找个人问一下，我们的iG20视频有没有可能能够快点审批过

说一下这是28个学校一起拍摄的，非常珍贵，前面格式传错了，十分抱歉。如果能够通过，万分感谢。

Dear Administrator, sorry to disturb you.

I'm a member of the LZU-CHINA iGEM team. We have uploaded a video titled “iGEM Group of 20 Project Introduction Video (2023) [English]” at the following link: https://video.igem.org/w/jbV9k1Kq2jkmMb2Q2zm1J2 many times. Unfortunately, we made an error in the format during our initial upload, and we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.

This video is a collaborative effort involving 28 schools, making it invaluable to all of us. We are hoping to have it approved in time if possible. We would greatly appreciate it if you could assist us in expediting the review process.

Thank you for your understanding and assistance. We look forward to your response.





Dear HQ,

I hope this message finds you well. We encountered a significant issue earlier. Due to heavy traffic on the wiki, two of our team members attempted to submit the judging forms simultaneously. Unfortunately, this resulted in the form we were working on suddenly displaying as a blank page, preventing us from completing our submission.

We wanted to bring this to your immediate attention and inquire if there's a possibility to rectify this situation. We genuinely believe that the submission failure was caused by this unforeseen bug. We've put tremendous effort into our project and are hopeful that we can still be considered for the awards despite this technical glitch.

Warm regards,

SUSU, LZU-CHINA



Dear iGEM Committee,

Sorry! I am writing on behalf of the Team LZU-CHINA participating in this year's iGEM competition.

It seems that we met a serious bug!  Just now, because the wiki was too jammed, a blank judging form was submitted to in 23.59 Oct. 12, we don't know the reason for that. Maybe this is the auto submit, or our two team members were trying to submit the judging forms at the same time.  But the result is that page was written suddenly turned into a blank page, which resulted in our failure in submission. We immediately responded to this problem with you, and wanted to ask whether there was a chance to remedy this bug. We sincerely want to say that the failure of the submission is due to the Bug problem, and we hope that we can still have the opportunity to be awarded.
LZU-CHINA
